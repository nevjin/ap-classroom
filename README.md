For the Check Answer functionality, open a quiz and press # to create a check answer button (Only works for MCQs)

For Autocompleter, open a quiz and click through all the questions and go to the very end and then press \ (Only autocompletes MCQs)

For video watcher, change USERID variable in content.js (instructions in file) and then open a video and it will be marked as watched.

**(I do not encourage cheating or any form of cheating using this tool. The completers are only intended to be used on ungraded work for the sake of clearing the dashboard. Check Answer should be used for instant feedback on MCQs - solve the problems yourself first!)**
